// TIP

    here we add bootstrap as a package, specifically the css part
    it's imported as raw sass code, with default variables and mixins. 
    webpack sass loader will compile it together with our written sass code
    the variables file comes before you bootstrap, if you have some 
    default bootstrap variables you want to change up, i'll show how

/**
 these below are modules of our css code. 
 instead of adding multiple css files to main document,
 or having one large bulky css file, we can keep them in 
 small files, each serving a purpose, then we add them
 all here. this is one of the good things about sass.
 
 this is the main sass file that is imported into 
 webpack. this is the beaity of using sass with webpack.
