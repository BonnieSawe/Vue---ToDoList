/**

// TIP

here we add mixins,
they are like predefined sets of rules that can be re-used anywhere, 
instead of writing repetitive code. 

in this case, we add font-family properties for the two fonts imported,
then we can re-use this elsewhere.

the good thing about this is, if we ever decide to change fonts, all we have
to do is go to _variables.scss file and change the values. the change will be
effected elsewhere. imagine how much work this would involve with normal css.
